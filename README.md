in this project we have developed a ML algorithm , which follows linear regression algorithm...
Here due to unavailability of dataset , we have tried to generate a series of random dataset , with our outstanding unique parameters
and further in the training loop we have tried to reduce the cost function as much as possible , by running a series of iterations with different learning rate and tolerance value
in future we aim to develope this model with a more suitable ml algo , based on our real time dataset
